# Sentiment-Classfication
The airline sentiment classification ipython notebook uses the US airlines datset available on Twitter to classify tweets into the following three classes: 
1) Neutral 2) Positive 3) Negative
A recurrent neural Network is used to achieve the objective .The first layer is a Embedding followed by a LSTM and then two Dense Layers.

I have provided the link to the colab notebook. At the same time the full code has been provided in .py file in the current repository.
