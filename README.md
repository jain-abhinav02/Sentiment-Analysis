# Sentiment-Classfication
The airline sentiment classification ipython notebook uses the US airlines datset available on Twitter to classify tweets into the following three classes: 
1) Neutral 2) Positive 3) Negative
A recurrent neural Network is used to achieve the objective .The first layer is a Embedding followed by a LSTM and then two Dense Layers.

I have provided the link to the colab notebook. At the same time the full code has been provided in .py file in the current repository.

## Things to learn
1. Using pre trained GloVe Embedding
2. Preparing an Embedding matrix for the same
3. Plotting data in Pandas
4. One Hot Encoder
5. Using regex expressions to manipulate strings
6. Tokenizer
7. Dropout and Batch Normalisation in Keras Sequential Model
